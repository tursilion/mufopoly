A Monopoly-inspired multi-player game for Mucks. Designed for Fuzzball and Glow mucks, tested on FB5.64.

See header for instructions. Though this works for me, it may require some effort on your muck - it has not been tested on newer versions of anything.

Hopefully well commented enough to update as needed.

Supports color ANSI 'graphics', multiple players and watchers. Trades, bankruptcy and morgages are all implemented. Multiple simultaneous games and custom board layouts are also possible.
